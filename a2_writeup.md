# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
What I struggled most with creating the fucntion was understanding what the inputs and outputs of this program would be. I wasn't sure with how the source and pattern lists intreracted with each other. 


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

The match function could be used to find spcific movies that align with the details the user provided in the search box. For example, if a user were to enter a movie genre "Horror", the match function could find the movie(s) inside the array or dictionary that has the word "horror" in it, and return them to the user.
